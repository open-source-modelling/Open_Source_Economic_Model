Financial institutions such as life insurers or pension funds have a fiduciary duty to manage long-term commitments to their customers. They initially collect premiums/contributions from their clients, and in exchange promise to provide a guarantee or a higher return at a further date. A large part of risk management in such companies is focused on making sure that the invested assets are managed in such a way as to guarantee the honouring of all commitments (pensions, annuities, insurance claims etc.). One such tool is an asset-liability model. Such models try to simulate three things simultaneously:
 - Evolution and performance of company's investments
 - Evolution of liabilities
 - The impact on profitability by different trading strategies in response to outflows and inflows throughout time  

## Description
The aim of this project is to write an Asset-Liability model that uses agent-based modelling concepts to generate insight on the company's portfolio. All technologies used are open-source and widely used (Pyhon and specific packages such as Pands, Numpy, Datetime etc.).

Ultimately, OSEM should be able to take as input:
 - Description and size of investments
 - Description of economic factors such as interest rates, credit spreads etc.
 - Description and size of outflows
 - Description of the factor influencing the size and timing of outflows
 - Description of planned new business that a company wishes to include into the projection

OSEM should be able to produce a projection of what would happen to the balance sheet of this company in 5, 10, 20, 50 years. 

## Methodology
The development of the OSEM model is still very much an ongoing project. However, a draft of the methodology document can be found in the [Documentation] folder as [OSEM pdf] or a [OSEM Jupyter notebook].

Specific deep dives into topics related to the methodology are available as Jupyter notebooks or pdf-s. The topics covered so far are:
 - Yield-curve calibration/projection [Term structure example] 
 - Equity pricing [Equity pricing example]
 - Fixed income pricing [Bond pricing example]
 - Summary charts [Summary charts example]

## Getting started
So far, we have produced a simple example that can be ran using the script `main.py`. A hypothetical portfolio of 3 equities and 3 corporate bonds and a single fixed liability cash flow profile. This example will grow as more development is committed to the main branch.
To run the example:
 - Download the OSEM repository
 - Open the Anaconda command prompt
 - Make the OSEM repository the root folder
 - Run the script main.py
 - In the folder Output, look at the cash flow time-series

A simple summary of what goes into the run and what are the outputs can be found in the [Summary pdf]

## Modelfile
If you use copilots to further develope the code, we have started assembling a modelingfile that can be used to refine the prompts. The file is located in the [llm_modelfile] folder.
